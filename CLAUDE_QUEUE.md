# Claude Task Queue

## Instructions for Claude:
1. After completing each task, automatically read this file and start the next PENDING task
2. Mark tasks as COMPLETED when done, then move to the next one
3. If no tasks with descriptions are found, keep rechecking this file until a new task appears
4. Never stop checking - continuously poll for new tasks even if the queue appears empty
5. Only process tasks that have a non-empty Description field

## Tasks:

### Task 1: [COMPLETED]
Description: Start the application so that it runs on the connected pixel 8a

### Task 2: [COMPLETED]
Description: the back button is not working on thepools selection page. review how other pages perform the back or previous page and tell me what if any the difference is.

FINDINGS: The pool_selection_screen has overcomplicated back navigation:
- Uses WillPopScope widget with complex dialog detection (lines 264-275)
- Custom IconButton with modal route checking (lines 278-294)
- Other working screens just use simple Navigator.of(context).pop()
- The complex logic is likely interfering with normal navigation

### Task 3: [COMPLETED]
Description: restart the app
