The previous build plan was a great outline but intentionally left out granular details to stay concise. The main missing components were:
1.  **A detailed application flow** that maps the user's journey from start to finish.
2.  **A specific breakdown of features** beyond the high-level descriptions.
3.  **The monetization strategy** for the in-app purchases.

This document serves as a second file to address those details, providing a clearer roadmap for the development team.

### Application Flow

This is a step-by-step walkthrough of a user's journey through the "Bragging Rights" application.

**Step 1: Onboarding & Profile Creation ðŸ“²**
* A new user opens the app and is greeted by a welcome screen.
* They choose their preferred sign-in method: email/password, Google, or Apple.
* They create a profile, choose a display name, and are given a starting balance of "Brag Coins."

**Step 2: Discovering Games & Pools ðŸ”Ž**
* The user lands on the **Home Screen**, which displays a feed of upcoming games.
* The games are categorized by sport (NFL, NBA, etc.) and can be filtered by location (e.g., "Texas Pools").
* The user taps on a game to see more details, including the odds and the "Community Pick" feature.

**Step 3: Placing a Wager & Inviting Friends ðŸ’¸**
* On the game's detail page, the user selects a team to win.
* They enter the amount of "Brag Coins" they want to wager. The app shows the potential payout based on the odds.
* After placing the wager, the user is prompted to invite friends from their contacts to join the same pool.

**Step 4: Real-Time Results & The "Peak" Experience ðŸ“Š**
* Once a game is live, the user can watch the "Brag Coins" change in real time.
* They can also view the **"Community Pick"** chart, which updates live as more users place their wagers.
* When the game is over, the app settles all wagers, and the user's "Brag Coin" balance is automatically updated. A notification informs them of their win or loss.

**Step 5: The Road to the Championship ðŸ“ˆ**
* The user's performance is tracked on local and overall leaderboards.
* As they win more games and accumulate "Brag Coins," they climb the ranks.
* By fulfilling the requirements (e.g., playing every game in a season), they become eligible for a spot in the national championship.

**Step 6: Securing a Legacy in the Hall of Fame ðŸ‘‘**
* At the end of a sports season, the app's backend runs its final calculation.
* The top-ranked, eligible user is crowned the **Bragging Rights Champion**.
* A push notification is sent out to all users announcing the new champion, and their name, title, and "Brag Coin" count are permanently added to the **Hall of Fame**.
