## Testing Checklist

## Notes

- Since ESPN Boxing API doesn't work, we'll need to rely on the grouped fights from Odds API
- Fighter stats will be limited to what's available from ESPN MMA API
- We should cache fighter data aggressively to avoid repeated API calls
- Consider adding a "Fight Predictor" feature based on historical stats
- May want to integrate with fighter social media for real-time updates
