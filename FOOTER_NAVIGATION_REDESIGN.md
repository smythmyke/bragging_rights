# Footer Navigation Redesign Proposal

## Current Issues
1. **Redundancy**: Some features appear in both header and footer
2. **Incomplete tabs**: "Discover", "Leaderboard", and "Profile" show "Coming Soon"
3. **Missing key features**: No direct access to betting, Edge intelligence, or wallet

## Current Navigation (5 tabs)
- Home
- My Pools
- Discover (not implemented)
- Leaderboard (not implemented)
- Profile (not implemented)

## Proposed New Navigation (5 tabs)

### Option 1: Action-Focused
```
[Bet] [Pools] [Home] [Edge] [Wallet]
```
- **Bet**: Quick access to place bets, active wagers
- **Pools**: Browse and join pools, view my pools
- **Home**: Dashboard with overview, quick actions
- **Edge**: Premium intelligence cards, insights
- **Wallet**: BR balance, transactions, buy more BR

### Option 2: Activity-Based
```
[Home] [Play] [Active] [Social] [Profile]
```
- **Home**: Dashboard overview
- **Play**: Place bets, join pools, quick play
- **Active**: My wagers, my pools, live tracking
- **Social**: Leaderboards, friends, achievements
- **Profile**: Settings, wallet, transaction history

### Option 3: Game-Centric (Recommended)
```
[Games] [Bets] [Pools] [Edge] [More]
```
- **Games**: Live/upcoming games with betting options
- **Bets**: Place bets, my wagers, bet history
- **Pools**: Join pools, my pools, create pool
- **Edge**: Intelligence cards, premium insights
- **More**: Profile, wallet, leaderboard, settings

## Implementation for Option 3

### Games Tab

## Benefits of New Design
1. **Clear primary actions**: Betting and pools are front and center
2. **Monetization focus**: Edge tab promotes premium features
3. **Reduced redundancy**: No overlap with header
4. **Scalable**: "More" tab can house additional features
5. **User-centric**: Focuses on what users do most

## Header Adjustments
Keep header minimal:
- Logo/Title
- BR Balance (clickable to wallet)
- Notifications bell

## Quick Actions (Remove from Home)
Move quick action cards to relevant tabs:
- "Quick Play" → Bets tab
- "My Wagers" → Bets tab
- "My Pools" → Pools tab
- "Buy BR" → More > Wallet

## Color Scheme
- Games: Blue (live action)
- Bets: Green (money/success)
- Pools: Purple (community)
- Edge: Gold (premium)
- More: Gray (utility)
