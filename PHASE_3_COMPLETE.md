# Phase 3 Complete: Multi-Endpoint Search Logic
**NBA Preseason Support - Search Logic Implemented**

**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Test Status:** ✅ PASSING (Live API test successful)

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### **1. Enhanced `getMatchOdds()` Method**

**Added `gameDate` parameter:**
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> getMatchOdds({
  required String sport,
  required String homeTeam,
  required String awayTeam,
  DateTime? gameDate, // NEW: Optional date for smart endpoint selection
})
```

**New Multi-Endpoint Search Logic:**

```dart
// Get applicable endpoints (filters by date if provided)
final endpoints = _getEndpointsForSport(sport, gameDate: gameDate);

// Try each endpoint in priority order
for (final endpoint in endpoints) {
  final events = await _getSportOddsForEndpoint(endpoint.key);

  // Search for matching game in this endpoint
  for (final event in events) {
    if (homeMatches && awayMatches) {
      // Return odds + season metadata
      return {
        'eventId': event['id'],
        'odds': odds,
        // NEW: Season metadata
        'season_type': endpoint.type.name,
        'season_label': endpoint.label,
        'endpoint_used': endpoint.key,
      };
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Queries multiple endpoints in priority order
- ✅ Returns on first match found
- ✅ Includes season metadata in response
- ✅ Falls back to next endpoint if no match
- ✅ Detailed debug logging

---

### **2. New Helper Method: `_getSportOddsForEndpoint()`**

```dart
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>?> _getSportOddsForEndpoint(String sportKey) async {
  final url = '$_baseUrl/sports/$sportKey/odds/?'
      'apiKey=$_apiKey'
      '&regions=us'
      '&markets=h2h,spreads,totals'
      '&oddsFormat=american';

  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(url));

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    final data = json.decode(response.body) as List;
    return data.cast<Map<String, dynamic>>();
  }

  return null;
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Encapsulates single endpoint query logic
- Reusable across multiple methods
- Consistent error handling
- Simplifies testing

## 🔄 How It Works - End-to-End Flow

### **Scenario: User Opens 76ers-Knicks Bet Selection Screen**

```
1. User taps on "Philadelphia 76ers @ New York Knicks" (Oct 2)
         ↓
2. bet_selection_screen.dart navigates with game data
         ↓
3. Screen calls OddsApiService.getMatchOdds(
     sport: 'nba',
     homeTeam: 'New York Knicks',
     awayTeam: 'Philadelphia 76ers',
     gameDate: DateTime(2025, 10, 2), // NEW parameter
   )
         ↓
4. getMatchOdds() calls _getEndpointsForSport('nba', Oct 2)
         ↓
5. Date filtering:
   - Oct 2 is in [Oct 1 - Oct 15]? YES → basketball_nba_preseason
   - Oct 2 is in [Oct 15 - Jun 30]? NO → skip basketball_nba
         ↓
6. Returns: [basketball_nba_preseason] (1 endpoint)
         ↓
7. Query basketball_nba_preseason endpoint
         ↓
8. Search 3 games for matching teams
         ↓
9. Match found!
   - Home: "New York Knicks" matches "New York Knicks" ✅
   - Away: "Philadelphia 76ers" matches "Philadelphia 76ers" ✅
         ↓
10. Extract odds from 4 bookmakers
         ↓
11. Return result with season metadata:
    {
      "odds": {...},
      "season_type": "preseason",
      "season_label": "PRESEASON",
      "endpoint_used": "basketball_nba_preseason"
    }
         ↓
12. bet_selection_screen displays:
    - Moneyline, Spread, Totals
    - (Future: PRESEASON badge in UI)
```

## 📊 Debug Logging Example

**Console Output:**
```
🎯 OddsApiService.getMatchOdds called

## 📝 What's Next: Phase 4 - UI Badges

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. Create `SeasonTypeBadge` widget
2. Update bet_selection_screen to display badge
3. Update home_screen game cards with badge
4. Update navigation to pass season metadata
5. Test UI with live NBA preseason games

**Files to Create:**
- `lib/widgets/season_type_badge.dart`

**Files to Modify:**
- `lib/screens/betting/bet_selection_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart`
- Navigation calls passing game data

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### **1. Game Date Not Always Available**
**Issue:** Some screens don't have game date when calling `getMatchOdds()`

**Workaround:** When `gameDate` is null, searches all endpoints

**Future Fix:** Ensure all navigation passes game date

### **2. API Quota Usage**
**Issue:** Checking multiple endpoints uses more API calls

**Mitigation:** Date filtering minimizes unnecessary calls

**Stats:**
- Before: 1 API call per sport
- After (with date): 1 API call (filtered)
- After (without date): 2 API calls for NBA (both endpoints)

### **3. Date Ranges Are Hardcoded**
**Issue:** NBA preseason dates may change year-to-year

**Future Enhancement:** Make date ranges configurable via admin panel

---

## ✅ Phase 3 Summary

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Enhanced `getMatchOdds()` with multi-endpoint search
2. ✅ Added `gameDate` parameter for smart filtering
3. ✅ Created `_getSportOddsForEndpoint()` helper
4. ✅ Added season metadata to response
5. ✅ Tested with live NBA preseason API
6. ✅ Verified 76ers-Knicks game works

**API Test Results:**
