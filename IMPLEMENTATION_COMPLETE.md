## üîê Firestore Schema

### **Collections Created:**

#### `user_intel_cards`
Stores purchased Intel Cards:
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  cardId: string,
  cardType: "IntelCardType.gameInjuryReport",
  purchasedAt: timestamp,
  brSpent: 50,
  gameId: string,
  expiresAt: timestamp,
  viewed: boolean,
  injuryData: {
    homeTeamName: string,
    awayTeamName: string,
    homeInjuries: [...],
    awayInjuries: [...],
    fetchedAt: timestamp
  }
}
```

#### `analytics_intel_purchases`
Tracks all purchases for analytics:
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  cardId: string,
  cardType: string,
  brCost: 50,
  sport: "NBA",
  gameId: string,
  purchasedAt: timestamp
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & TODOs

### **Team ID Extraction**
Currently using placeholder logic for team IDs. Need to:
1. Extract team IDs from ESPN event data
2. Update `bet_selection_screen.dart` to pass team IDs in navigation arguments
3. Update `_loadInjuryReport()` to use real team IDs

**Workaround:** ESPN API can look up teams by name, but team IDs would be more reliable.

### **Team Logos**
ESPN team logos use format:
```
https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/{sport}/500/{teamAbbreviation}.png
```

Need to map team names ‚Üí abbreviations or extract from ESPN API.

### **Injury Data Refresh**
- Injury data is cached in Firestore when purchased
- Should implement refresh mechanism (every 30 min before game)
- Add "Last Updated" timestamp display

### **Expired Card Cleanup**
- `IntelCardService.cleanupExpiredCards()` method exists
- Should be called periodically (Cloud Function or app startup)

## üìä Revenue Projections

**Conservative Scenario (100k Active Users):**
- 10% adoption rate = 10,000 Intel buyers
- 3 cards/week per user √ó 50 BR = 1.5M BR/week
- At $0.01/BR = **$13,636/week = $709K/year**

**Optimistic Scenario (100k Active Users):**
- 20% adoption rate = 20,000 Intel buyers
- 5 cards/week per user √ó 50 BR = 5M BR/week
- At $0.01/BR = **$45,455/week = $2.36M/year**
