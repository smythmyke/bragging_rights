## ✅ Summary

**We have enough APIs to provide excellent NHL coverage!**

- **Core APIs**: ✅ NHL Official + ESPN (same as NBA structure)
- **Reusable APIs**: ✅ News, Reddit, Odds, Logos all work
- **Main Gap**: Just need to connect the services to EdgeIntelligenceService

The NHL implementation is 80% complete - we have all the data sources, they just need to be wired together in the main intelligence service. This would take about 1-2 hours to complete.
