## üí° Best Practices

1. **Cache data aggressively** - Especially standings and team stats
2. **Batch API calls** - Request multiple games at once
3. **Handle missing data gracefully** - Not all fields always populated
4. **Update odds frequently** - Every 5-10 minutes for live games
5. **Parse news for insights** - Extract injury info from article text
6. **Combine data sources** - Use both APIs to create comprehensive view
