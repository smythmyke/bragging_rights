## Caching Strategy (Following Soccer Model)

### ESPN ID Resolution & Caching
Just like with soccer, we need to efficiently resolve and cache ESPN IDs for NBA games:

1. **First Check**: Look for ESPN ID in game data
2. **Memory Cache**: Check in-memory cache (instant)
3. **Firestore Cache**: Check `id_mappings` collection
4. **ESPN API Match**: If not cached, match with ESPN scoreboard
5. **Save Mapping**: Store in Firestore for future use

### Data Fetching Flow
```
1. Game Details Request
   â†“
2. Check if ESPN ID exists
   â†“
3. If yes â†’ Fetch summary from ESPN (with caching)
   â†“
4. If no â†’ Resolve ID using EspnIdResolverService
   â†“
5. Cache resolved ID in Firestore
   â†“
6. Fetch and cache game details
```

### Implementation Example
```dart
// Similar to soccer implementation
Future<void> _loadNBAGameDetails() async {
  // 1. Check for ESPN ID
  String? espnId = widget.gameData?.espnId;

  // 2. If no ESPN ID, resolve it
  if (espnId == null || espnId.isEmpty) {
    final resolver = EspnIdResolverService();
    espnId = await resolver.resolveEspnId(widget.gameData!);
  }

  // 3. Fetch summary data (will be cached)
  if (espnId != null) {
    final url = 'https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/summary?event=$espnId';
    // Fetch and cache data
  }
}
```

### Caching Rules
- **Live Games**: Update every 30 seconds (scores only)
- **Upcoming Today**: Refresh every 5 minutes
- **Future Games**: Cache for 6-24 hours based on proximity
- **Completed Games**: Cache for 7 days

### Firestore Structure
```
games/
  {gameId}/
    - espnId: "401812480"
    - lastFetched: Timestamp
    - lastScoreUpdate: Timestamp
    - sport: "NBA"
    - gameTime: Timestamp
    - detailsData: {
        standings: {...},
        leaders: {...},
        injuries: {...},
        lastFiveGames: {...}
      }

id_mappings/
  {oddsApiGameId}/
    - espnId: "401812480"
    - sport: "NBA"
    - teams: {...}
    - verified: true
```

### Efficient Data Loading
1. **Batch Loading**: Load all tab data in one API call
2. **Selective Updates**: Only update changed data (scores for live games)
3. **Background Refresh**: Update non-visible tabs in background
4. **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Show cached data immediately, update in background
