## Implementation Notes

### Caching Strategy (Following Soccer/NBA Model)
```dart
Future<void> _loadNFLDetails() async {
  // 1. Use ESPN ID resolver
  final resolver = EspnIdResolverService();
  var espnGameId = _game?.espnId;

  if (espnGameId == null && _game != null) {
    espnGameId = await resolver.resolveEspnId(_game!);
  }

  // 2. IMPORTANT: Use FirestoreCacheService!
  final cacheService = FirestoreCacheService();

  // 3. Check cache first
  final cachedData = await cacheService.getGameDetails(
    gameId: widget.gameId,
    espnId: espnGameId,
    sport: 'NFL',
  );

  if (cachedData != null && cacheService.isFresh(cachedData, _game!)) {
    setState(() => _eventDetails = cachedData);
    return;
  }

  // 4. Only fetch if cache miss or stale
  final url = 'https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/summary?event=$espnGameId';
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(url));

  // 5. Cache the response
  await cacheService.cacheGameDetails(
    gameId: widget.gameId,
    espnId: espnGameId,
    sport: 'NFL',
    data: json.decode(response.body),
  );
}
```

### NFL-Specific Considerations

1. **Weather Handling**:
   - Only show weather tab for outdoor stadiums
   - Check venue.indoor flag
   - Update weather more frequently for live games

2. **Game States**:
   - Pre-game (show inactives)
   - In-progress (live drive tracker)
   - Halftime (halftime stats)
   - Final (full box score)
   - Overtime (special OT rules)

3. **Season Context**:
   - Regular season (17 games)
   - Playoffs (single elimination)
   - Super Bowl (neutral site)

4. **Fantasy Integration**:
   - High importance for NFL
   - Player projections vs actual
   - Snap counts when available

## Lessons Learned for Other Sports

1. **Check for sport-specific data**: NFL has weather, combat sports might have fight cards
2. **Venue information matters**: Indoor vs outdoor affects available data
3. **Season structure varies**: NFL has divisions, tennis has tournaments
4. **Cache differently based on context**: Playoff games might need different cache rules
5. **Always test with real game IDs**: Structure can vary between pre-season/regular/playoffs
