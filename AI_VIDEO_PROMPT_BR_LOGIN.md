# AI Video Generation Prompt for Bragging Rights Login Success Animation

## Video Specifications
- **Duration:** 3-4 seconds
- **Resolution:** 1080x2340 pixels (9:20 aspect ratio - standard mobile phone portrait)
- **Format:** MP4, H.264 codec
- **Frame Rate:** 30 fps
- **File Size:** Target under 2MB
- **Background:** Transparent or pure black (#000000)

## Visual Description

### Background Grid Pattern
The video should incorporate an animated neon gold grid pattern with these characteristics:
- **Grid Lines:** Gold color (#FFD700) with 30% base opacity
- **Line Spacing:** 40 pixels between lines
- **Grid Animation:**
  - Lines should have a subtle perspective effect (converging towards a vanishing point)
  - Horizontal lines get closer together towards the top (perspective factor)
  - Vertical lines converge slightly towards center
  - A scanning line effect moves from top to bottom with glowing gold gradient
  - Lines pulse with varying opacity (20-30% variance)
  - The grid slowly moves forward creating a tunnel/depth effect

### Main Animation Sequence

**Phase 1: Gold Flash (0-0.5 seconds)**
- Start with a bright gold flash (#FFD700) that fills the entire screen
- The flash should have a radial gradient from center outward
- Intensity peaks at 0.2 seconds then quickly fades to reveal the logo

**Phase 2: Logo Reveal (0.5-1.5 seconds)**
- "BRAGGING RIGHTS" text appears in bold, metallic gold lettering
- Font style: Bold, sans-serif, slightly italicized for dynamic feel
- The text should have:
  - Metallic gold gradient effect
  - Subtle 3D extrusion
  - Soft glow/bloom effect around edges
  - Slight reflection/shine that moves across the letters

**Phase 3: Camera Fly-Through (1.5-3.5 seconds)**
- Camera begins to move forward towards the logo
- As it approaches, the viewpoint flies between the letters "G" and "G" in "BRAGGING"
- Camera perspective:
  - Starts centered on the full logo
  - Accelerates forward with smooth easing
  - Passes through the gap between letters
  - Letters should have depth/3D thickness visible as camera passes
  - Motion blur on the edges as speed increases
  - After passing through, continue forward into darkness/fade to black

### Additional Effects
- **Particle Effects:** Small gold sparkles/particles that trail behind the camera movement
- **Light Streaks:** Subtle light streaks that emphasize the forward motion
- **Depth of Field:** Letters in the foreground and background should blur as camera passes
- **Grid Integration:** The grid should be visible throughout but becomes more prominent as camera moves forward

## Color Palette
- Primary Gold: #FFD700
- Secondary Gold: #FFC107
- Dark Background: #000000
- Accent Glow: #FFED4E (for highlights)

## Audio (Optional)
- Swoosh/whoosh sound effect synchronized with the fly-through
- Subtle "power-up" sound for the initial gold flash
- Keep audio minimal and under 0.5 seconds total

## Technical Notes
- Ensure the video loops seamlessly if needed
- Optimize for mobile playback (no heavy effects that cause lag)
- The video should work well when overlaid on a dark background
- Consider creating a version with alpha channel for transparency if possible

## Reference Style
Think "Marvel Studios intro" meets "Tron Legacy grid" with a gold sports trophy aesthetic. The overall feel should be premium, exciting, and victory-oriented.

## File Naming
Output file should be named: `BR_Login_Success_Animation_Mobile.mp4`
