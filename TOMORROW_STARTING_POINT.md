# Tomorrow's Starting Point - Sept 4, 2025

## üéØ Current State Summary

The app is **99% complete** with all major features implemented. Today (Sept 3) we successfully added:
- Power Cards system with UI and sounds
- Strategy Room with three-phase card selection
- Intel products with purchase flow
- Fixed pool selection issues (flickering, membership tracking)
- Firestore security rules for new subcollections

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- User authentication and registration
- Pool selection with membership tracking
- Power cards with visual effects and sounds
- Strategy Room with Firebase integration
- Intel products in Edge tab
- Wallet system with balance management
- All 7 sports APIs integrated
- 35+ Cloud Functions deployed

## üêõ Known Issues to Address
1. **Windows Developer Mode** - Required for running with plugins
2. **Google Sign-In** - Temporarily disabled, needs configuration
3. **Pool Auto-Creation** - Buttons exist but need implementation
4. **Sound Testing** - Not yet tested on physical device

## üöÄ Tomorrow's Priority Tasks

### 1. Test on Physical Device (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Enable Windows Developer Mode if not already done
- [ ] Connect Pixel 8a device
- [ ] Test power card sounds
- [ ] Test Strategy Room submission
- [ ] Verify pool membership tracking works

### 2. Complete Pool Auto-Creation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
```dart
// In pool_service.dart, implement:
Future<String> createAutoPool(PoolType type, String gameId) async {
  // Generate pool with default settings
  // Add to Firestore
  // Return pool ID
}
```

### 3. Add Loading States (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Add loading indicators for async operations
- [ ] Improve error messages with user-friendly text
- [ ] Add success animations for purchases

### 4. Test Full User Flow (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Register new account
- [ ] Join/create pool
- [ ] Make picks
- [ ] Add power cards via Strategy Room
- [ ] Purchase intel products
- [ ] Verify wallet balance updates

## üìù Code Locations Reference

### Key Files Modified Today:
- `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart` - Sound integration
- `lib/screens/pools/pool_selection_screen_v2.dart` - Membership tracking
- `lib/screens/pools/strategy_room_screen.dart` - Card selection
- `lib/screens/card_detail_screen.dart` - Purchase flow
- `lib/screens/intel_detail_screen.dart` - Intel purchases
- `lib/services/sound_service.dart` - Audio playback
- `lib/services/wallet_service.dart` - Balance methods
- `lib/models/game_state_model.dart` - Fixed enum
- `lib/models/intel_product.dart` - Added properties
- `firestore.rules` - Security updates

### Important Services:
- **WalletService**: Use `getCurrentBalance()` not `getBalance()`
- **SoundService**: Must call `initialize()` before use
- **PoolService**: Check `joinPool()` for membership validation
- **CardService**: Handles power card purchases

## üí° Quick Fixes Reference

### If pool flickering returns:
Check for `Timer.periodic` with empty `setState()`

### If wallet permission errors:
Check Firestore rules for `/users/{userId}/wallet/` path

### If sound doesn't play:
1. Check sound file exists in `assets/sounds/`
2. Verify `pubspec.yaml` includes sound assets
3. Call `_soundService.initialize()` in initState

### If "already in pool" error:
Use `_userPoolIds.contains(pool.id)` to check membership

## üé¨ Starting Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
