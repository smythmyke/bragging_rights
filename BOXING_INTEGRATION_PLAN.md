# Boxing Integration Plan for Edge Intelligence
## Treating Boxing as a Separate Sport

---

## ü•ä Overview

Boxing will be implemented as a **separate sport** from MMA in the Edge Intelligence system, despite sharing similar fight card structures. This ensures proper sport-specific analytics and maintains clean separation of concerns.

---

## üìä API Reusability Analysis

### ‚úÖ Fully Reusable APIs (No Changes Needed)

1. **ESPN API**
   - Endpoint: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/boxing/`
   - Provides: Fight cards, fighter profiles, odds, results
   - Already partially implemented in `espn_mma_service.dart`
   - Will create separate `espn_boxing_service.dart`

2. **The Odds API**
   - Already integrated and working
   - Boxing markets supported:
     - Moneyline (fighter to win)
     - Method of victory (KO/TKO, Decision, Draw)
     - Round betting (fight to end in round X)
     - Over/under rounds
   - No changes needed

3. **NewsAPI**
   - Current implementation fully supports boxing
   - Query format: "boxing [fighter name]" or "[event name] boxing"
   - No changes needed

4. **Reddit Service**
   - Already has r/Boxing configured
   - `getFightCardIntelligence()` method will work
   - Additional boxing subreddits to add:
     - r/Boxing (2M+ subscribers)
     - r/boxingcirclejerk (memes/casual)
     - r/boxingdiscussion (technical analysis)
   - Minor updates needed for boxing-specific sentiment

---

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### 1. Create Separate Boxing Service
```
lib/services/edge/sports/espn_boxing_service.dart
```
- Independent from MMA service
- Boxing-specific data models
- Proper round counting (4, 6, 8, 10, 12 rounds)
- Belt organization tracking

### 2. Sport Identification
```dart
// In EdgeIntelligenceService
case 'boxing':
  intelligence.data['boxing'] = await _gatherBoxingIntelligence(
    homeTeam: eventMatch.homeTeam,  // Fighter 1
    awayTeam: eventMatch.awayTeam,  // Fighter 2
    eventContext: eventContext,
  );
  break;
```

### 3. Boxing-Specific Data Structure
```dart
{
  'sport': 'boxing',
  'eventType': 'championship',  // or 'title eliminator', 'regular'
  'rounds': 12,
  'weightClass': 'Super Middleweight',
  'belts': ['WBA', 'WBC', 'IBF', 'WBO'],  // Organizations involved
  'mainEvent': {
    'fighter1': {
      'name': 'Canelo Alvarez',
      'record': '59-2-2',
      'kos': 39,
      'stance': 'Orthodox',
      'reach': 70.5,
      'height': 68,
      'age': 33,
      'nationality': 'Mexico',
      'lastFight': '2024-05-04',
      'trainer': 'Eddy Reynoso',
      'promoter': 'Premier Boxing Champions'
    },
    'fighter2': { ... },
    'odds': { ... },
    'judgeHistory': { ... },
    'venueBias': { ... }
  },
  'undercard': [ ... ],
  'predictions': [ ... ]
}
```

---

## üé® UI Considerations

### Display Elements - Boxing Specific

1. **Fight Header**
   ```
   Canelo Alvarez vs Jermell Charlo
   12 Rounds - Super Middleweight
   üèÜ WBA/WBC/IBF/WBO Undisputed Championship
   ```

2. **Fighter Stats Card**
   ```
   Record: 59-2-2 (39 KOs)
   KO Rate: 66%
   Stance: Orthodox
   Reach: 70.5"
   Last 5: WWWWW
   ```

3. **Boxing-Specific Edge Cards**
   - **Style Matchup**: Pressure Fighter vs Counter Puncher
   - **Championship Experience**: 15 title fights (13-2)
   - **Judge Analysis**: Judge X favors aggressive style (relevant to Fighter 1)
   - **Activity Level**: 8 months since last fight (ring rust factor)
   - **Punch Stats History**: Avg 45 punches/round, 38% accuracy
   - **Chin Durability**: KO'd once in 63 fights
   - **Promoter Influence**: Fighting on Showtime (home advantage)

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
lib/services/edge/sports/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ espn_boxing_service.dart (NEW)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ espn_mma_service.dart (EXISTING - keep separate)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ boxing_models.dart (NEW)
```

### Boxing-Specific Models
```dart
class BoxingEvent {
  final String eventId;
  final String title;
  final DateTime date;
  final List<BoxingFight> fights;
  final String venue;
  final String broadcaster;  // HBO, Showtime, DAZN, ESPN+
}

class BoxingFight {
  final BoxingFighter fighter1;
  final BoxingFighter fighter2;
  final int scheduledRounds;
  final String weightClass;
  final List<String> beltsAtStake;
  final bool isMainEvent;
  final BoxingOdds odds;
}

class BoxingFighter {
  final String name;
  final String record;  // "59-2-2"
  final int knockouts;
  final String stance;  // Orthodox, Southpaw, Switch
  final double reach;   // in inches
  final double height;  // in inches
  final String trainer;
  final String promoter;
  final List<String> titles;  // Current belts held
  final Map<String, dynamic> lastFightStats;
}
```

### Intelligence Generation
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _gatherBoxingIntelligence({
  required String fighter1,
  required String fighter2,
  Map<String, dynamic>? eventContext,
}) async {
  // 1. Get fight card from ESPN
  // 2. Get fighter profiles and history
  // 3. Get odds from The Odds API
  // 4. Get news from NewsAPI
  // 5. Get Reddit sentiment
  // 6. Generate boxing-specific insights:
  //    - Style matchup analysis
  //    - Judge/referee tendencies
  //    - Venue/promoter advantages
  //    - Activity level impact
  //    - Weight cut concerns
  //    - Historical performance patterns
}
```

## üìà Boxing-Specific Analytics

### Key Factors to Track

1. **KO Probability Model**

   Inside Fighter vs Outside Fighter: Depends on ring generalship
   ```
